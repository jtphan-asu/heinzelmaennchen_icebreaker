There once was a Hund who lived in Berlin, right next to the Flughafen.
The Hund often ate dinner in the Ratskeller, located inside Flughafen.
His dinner mainly consisted of brot, bratwurst, and various bits of Flughafen trash that he dug through in his spare time looking for bones.
Occassionally, he visits the Baekerei for some leftover Gebaeck and also loves the smell of the Biergarten.
