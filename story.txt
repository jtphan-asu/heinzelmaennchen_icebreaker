There once was a Hund who lived in Berlin, right next to the Flughafen.
The Hund often ate dinner in the Ratskeller, located inside Flughafen.
His dinner mainly consisted of brot, bratwurst, and various bits of Flughafen trash that he dug through in his spare time looking for bones.
Occasionally, he visits the Baekerei for some leftover Gebaeck and also loves the smell of the Biergarten. 
During his last visit to the Biergarten, he fell into the Ratskeller and broke the Klimaanlage.
The hund then ran away and went towards the Hauptstrasse in Munich. 
He dodge the BMW but was nearly hit by the Porsche as he approach Gauss looking for his owner. 
The hund's owner was dressed in a Dirndel which had printed on Mehlhases.
He was standing in front of a Baeckerei where fresh Gebaeck was displayed.
Interesting enough, this Baeckerei is called Biergarten that serves Bratwurst along with beer.
It was the tastiest Bier within 100km. It was called Leckerbrau.
Leckerbrau is Germany's most favorite brand based in Munich.
